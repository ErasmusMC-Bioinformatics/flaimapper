	* (v1.1.6) Fixed a GFF/GTF parsing error - FlaiMapper only supported
	  annotations with the score value set.
	
	* (v1.1.5) Removed warning written to stderr that should be reported
	  to stdout.
	
	* (v1.1.4) Tabix libraries from the pysam library have been replaced
	  with flaimapper libraries because of multiple incompatibility
	  issues.
	
	* (v1.1.3) Pysam 0.8.2.1 shows different behavior with the
	  TabixFile.fetch() function when no arguments are given. Flaimapper
	  has been made compatible also with the latest version of pysam.

	* (v1.1.2) Found and disabled an unnecessairy double exectution of a
	  'run' function which caused double calculation time.

	* (v1.1.1) Added "src/bin/gtf-from-fasta" and added the file to the
	  installer. This file makes it posible to create a mask file that
	  corresponds to a reference fasta file (only if mature ncRNAs are
	  given in the fasta file).
