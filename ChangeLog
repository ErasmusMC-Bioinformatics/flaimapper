	* (v1.1.2) Found and disabled an unnecessairy double exectution of a
	  'run' function which caused double calculation time.

	* (v1.1.1) Added "src/bin/gtf-from-fasta" and added the file to the
	  installer. This file makes it posible to create a mask file that
	  corresponds to a reference fasta file (only if mature ncRNAs are
	  given in the fasta file).
