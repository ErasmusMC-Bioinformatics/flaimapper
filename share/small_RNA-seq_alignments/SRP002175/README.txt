The originial reads have been taken from:

ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sra-instant/reads/ByStudy/sra/SRP/SRP002/SRP002175/

They have been aligned to the ncRNA reference database using Short Sequence Location Mapper (SSLM):

http://www.gatcplatform.nl/

This directory only contains the results generated using SSLM. SSLM uses MUSCLe under the hood.
