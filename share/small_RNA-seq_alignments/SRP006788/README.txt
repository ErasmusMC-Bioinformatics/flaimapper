The originial reads have been taken from:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE29116
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP006788

They have been aligned to the ncRNA reference database using Short Sequence Location Mapper (SSLM):

This directory only contains the results generated using SSLM. SSLM uses MUSCLe under the hood.
